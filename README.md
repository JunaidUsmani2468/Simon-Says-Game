# 🎮 Simon Says Web Game

Welcome to the ultimate test of memory and reflexes! This isn't just a random clicking game; it's a digital workout for your brain designed to push your recall skills to the limit.

I built this project to master DOM manipulation and game logic in vanilla JavaScript. Beyond just flashing colors, the game features a **smart "Game Over" visual feedback system**, **persistent High Score tracking** to keep you competitive, and a newly refactored **Start Button** logic that makes the game robust on all devices.

### 🚀 Live Demo:

**Click here to challenge your memory and beat the high score 👉 [🔴🔵🟢🟡](https://junaidusmani2468.github.io/Simon-Says-Game/)**

> **📱 Play Anywhere:** Unlike the original tutorial which was PC-only, this version is **Fully Responsive**! Whether you are on a Laptop, Tablet, or Smartphone, the UI adapts perfectly. No broken layouts here! 📲

## ✨ Features

- **Fully Responsive:** Unlike the original tutorial version which was PC-only, this version is optimized for **Mobile and Desktop** play.
- **Start Button:** Logic refactored to use a dedicated start button instead of global keypresses, preventing accidental starts on touch screens.
- **High Score Tracking:** Keeps track of your best performance during the session.
- **Visual Feedback:** Interactive button flashes and game-over animations.

## 🤫 Developer Secret (PC Only)

There is a hidden advantage for PC players...
If you want to reach a high score effortlessly (like Level 14+), just **open the Console Window** (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I). The game logic logs the color sequence (`gameSeq`) explicitly! 😉

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** (Structure)
- **CSS3** (Styling & Responsive Layout)
- **JavaScript** (Game Logic & DOM Manipulation)

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Special thanks to **Shradha Khapra** (Apna College) for the logic inspiration and tutorial guidance. I extended the original project by adding responsive mobile support and button-based interaction controls.
